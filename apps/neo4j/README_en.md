# Neo4j
**Neo4j** is the world's leading graph database. It is a high-performance graph storage system with all the features required by a mature and powerful database, such as a user-friendly query language and ACID transactions. Developers can work with flexible node and relationship network structures instead of static tables while enjoying the benefits of enterprise-grade databases. For many applications, Neo4j offers orders-of-magnitude performance advantages over relational databases.

## Core Features
### 1. Graph Data Model
- **Nodes**: The basic unit of a graph database, representing entities.
- **Relationships**: Directed connections between nodes, representing relationships between entities.
- **Properties**: Key-value pairs attached to nodes and relationships to describe their characteristics.

### 2. Cypher Query Language
- **Declarative Query Language**: Similar to SQL but designed for graph databases.
- **Pattern Matching**: Query based on graph patterns, simple and efficient.
- **Read and Write Operations**: Supports complex queries, inserts, updates, and deletions.

### 3. ACID Transaction Support
- **Atomicity**: Ensures all operations succeed or roll back on failure.
- **Consistency**: Transitions the database from one consistent state to another.
- **Isolation**: Prevents interference between concurrent transactions.
- **Durability**: Ensures data persistence after transaction commits.

### 4. High Performance and Scalability
- **In-Memory Graph Processing**: Most operations are completed in memory for speed.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Supports sharding and replication for large-scale data processing.

### 5. Visualization Tools
- **Neo4j Browser**: Built-in interactive visualization tool for queries and results.
- **Neo4j Bloom**: Advanced data visualization and exploration tool for business users.

### 6. Security and Access Control
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Role-based access control to ensure data security.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Protects data transmission security.
