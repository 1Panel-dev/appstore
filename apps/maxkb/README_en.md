**MaxKB** = Max Knowledge Brain, it is an open-source platform for building enterprise-grade agents. MaxKB integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, supports robust workflows, and provides advanced MCP tool-use capabilities. MaxKB is widely applied in scenarios such as intelligent customer service, corporate internal knowledge bases, academic research, and education.

## Advantage
