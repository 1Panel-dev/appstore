# MaxKB

**MaxKB** = Max Knowledge Brain, it is a powerful and easy-to-use AI assistant that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, supports robust workflows, and provides advanced MCP tool-use capabilities. MaxKB is widely applied in scenarios such as intelligent customer service, corporate internal knowledge bases, academic research, and education.

## Advantage

- **RAG Pipeline**: Supports direct uploading of documents / automatic crawling of online documents, with features for automatic text splitting, vectorization, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). This effectively reduces hallucinations in large models, providing a superior smart Q&A interaction experience.
- **Flexible Orchestration**: Equipped with a powerful workflow engine, function library and MCP tool-use, enabling the orchestration of AI processes to meet the needs of complex business scenarios. 
- **Seamless Integration**: Facilitates zero-coding rapid integration into third-party business systems, quickly equipping existing systems with intelligent Q&A capabilities to enhance user satisfaction.
- **Model-Agnostic**: Supports various large models, including private models (such as DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen, etc.) and public models (like OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
- **Multi Modal**: Native support for input and output text, image, audio and video.
