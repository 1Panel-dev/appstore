# Prometheus

**Prometheus** is a monitoring system and time-series database.

## Key Features:

- Multidimensional data model, where time series data is identified by metric names and key/value pairs.
- PromQL, a flexible query language that leverages this dimensionality.
- No reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous.
- Time series collection is performed via a pull model over HTTP.
- Supports pushing time series via an intermediary gateway.
- Targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration.
- Multiple modes of graphing and dashboard support.
