Cloudflared is a tool provided by Cloudflare for creating secure connections and exposing private networks and services to the public internet.

## Instructions:

1. **Installation and Setup:**
   - Cloudflared is a connector application tool used to connect private services and networks to Cloudflare's network. You can find detailed installation and setup steps in [Cloudflare's official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/).

2. **Run Cloudflared Container:**
   - Example command to run the Cloudflared container using Docker:
     ```shell
     docker run cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel --no-autoupdate --hello-world
     ```
     > This example uses the `--hello-world` parameter, relying on trycloudflare.com, and does not require a Cloudflare account. It is designed as a single command for quick start.

3. **Practical Use:**
   - For practical use, it is recommended to create a free Cloudflare account and create a tunnel in the Access -> Tunnels section of the [Cloudflare Console](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/). There, you will receive a one-liner command to start and run the Cloudflared Docker container, requiring authentication via your Cloudflare account.

4. **Use Cases:**
   - Cloudflared can be used to expose private HTTP services to public DNS hostnames, optionally with access control via Cloudflare Access.
   - It can also connect private networks, allowing WARP-registered users to access via TCP/UDP IP/port, implementing Zero Trust security policies and avoiding traditional VPN usage.
