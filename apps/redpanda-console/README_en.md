# Redpanda Console

**Redpanda Console** is a developer-friendly UI for managing Kafka/Redpanda workloads. The console provides an interactive way to understand topics, mask data, manage consumer groups, and explore real-time data through time-travel debugging.

## Main Features:

- **Message Viewer**: Explore your topic messages through ad-hoc queries and dynamic filters in our message viewer. Use JavaScript functions to filter messages and find exactly what youâ€™re looking for. Supported encodings include JSON, Avro, Protobuf, XML, MessagePack, Text, and Binary (hex view). Encodings (except Protobuf) are automatically recognized.
- **Consumer Groups**: List all active consumer groups and their group offset, edit group offsets (by group, topic, or partition), or delete consumer groups.
- **Topic Overview**: Browse Kafka topic lists, inspect their configurations, space usage, list all consumers using a single topic, or observe partition details (e.g., low watermark, high watermark, message count, etc.), embed topic documentation from git repositories, and more.
- **Cluster Overview**: List ACLs, available brokers, their space usage, rack IDs, and other information for a high-level overview of brokers in the cluster.
- **Schema Registry**: List all Avro, Protobuf, or JSON schemas in the schema registry.
- **Kafka Connect**: Manage connectors from multiple connect clusters, patch configurations, view their current status, or restart tasks.
