# Watchtower
Watchtower is an open-source tool for automatically updating Docker containers. It detects whether new versions of the Docker containers you are running are available and automatically updates them, helping to maintain the security and stability of containerized applications.

## Key Features:
- **Automatic Container Updates**: Watchtower periodically checks Docker Hub or other container registries for updated images. If a new version is found, it automatically downloads the new image and updates the running container.
- **Scheduled Checks**: Configure Watchtower to periodically check containers to ensure they are always up-to-date. You can set the time interval for checks.
- **Email Notifications**: Watchtower can be configured to send email notifications when containers are updated, keeping you informed of changes.
- **Flexibility**: Exclude specific containers from automatic updates to meet particular requirements.
- **Logging**: Watchtower logs container updates, allowing you to review the update history at any time.
- **Support for Multiple Container Registries**: In addition to Docker Hub, Watchtower supports other container registries, enabling you to use your preferred container images.
