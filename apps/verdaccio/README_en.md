# Verdaccio

**Verdaccio** is a simple, **zero-configuration local private npm registry**. You can start using it without needing a full database! Verdaccio works out of the box with **its own lightweight database** and can proxy other registries (e.g., npmjs.org), caching downloaded modules along the way. For users who want to extend storage capabilities, Verdaccio **supports various community-made plugins to integrate with services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc., or you can create your own plugins**.
