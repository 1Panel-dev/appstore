# Huginn
**Huginn** is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you online. They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf. Huginn's agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph. Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server. You always know who owns your data. You do.

## Here are some things you can use Huginn to do:
- Track the weather and get an email when it will rain (or snow) tomorrow ("Don't forget your umbrella!").
- List terms you care about and get an email when their occurrence on Twitter changes. (For example, want to know when something interesting happens in machine learning? Huginn will watch the term "machine learning" on Twitter and notify you when there's a spike in discussion.)
- Monitor airline travel or shopping deals.
- Watch your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them.
- Scrape websites and receive emails when they change.
- Connect to Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, Translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, Weibo, and more.
- Send a daily digest email at a specific time of day with things you care about.
- Track the number of high-frequency events and send an SMS immediately when there's a spike, such as "San Francisco emergency incidents."
- Send and receive WebHooks.
- Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions.
- Track changes in your location over time.
- Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as inputs or outputs for agents (Amazon Turk agents are called "HumanTaskAgent"). For example: "Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat picture; send the results to another 5 people for rating; send the highest-rated picture to 5 more people to add a funny caption; send the captioned picture to 5 more people for rating; finally, post the picture with the best caption to my blog."
