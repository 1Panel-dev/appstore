## Introduction

Forgejo is a lightweight, privacy-first self-hosted Git service platform driven by an independent community. The project forked from Gitea in 2022, aiming to provide a forever independent and free software collaboration platform, avoiding the monopoly of large platforms. Forgejo offers an intuitive interface, easy deployment, and includes rich built-in features, making it suitable for individuals, teams, companies, or communities for code hosting, project management, and collaborative development. Its core values emphasize privacy, community ownership, and customizability, targeting developers who need self-hosted Git services, open-source project maintainers, and organizations that prioritize data control.
