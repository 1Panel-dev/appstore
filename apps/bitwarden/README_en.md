# Bitwarden

Bitwarden is an open-source password manager that offers robust security and convenient password management features. This repository implements an alternative server for the Bitwarden client API, written in Rust, and is fully compatible with the official Bitwarden client. It is particularly well-suited for self-hosted deployments, especially when running the resource-intensive official server is not ideal.

After deploying the server, users can continue to use Bitwarden's official APP and browser extensions with the compatible API service.
