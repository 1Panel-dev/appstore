## Introduction

**AFFiNE** is an open-source integrated workspace and operating system for building knowledge bases and more—wiki, knowledge management, presentations, and digital assets. It's a better alternative to Notion and Miro.

## Features

### True canvas for blocks of any form, documents and whiteboards now fully merged.

- Many editor apps claim to be productivity canvases, but AFFiNE is one of the very few apps that allows you to place any building block on an infinite canvas—rich text, sticky notes, embedded webpages, multi-view databases, linked pages, shapes, and even slideshows. We have it all.

### Multi-mode AI partner ready for any task

- Writing professional work reports? Turning outlines into expressive and easy-to-present slideshows? Summarizing articles into well-structured mind maps? Organizing work plans and to-dos? Or... drawing and writing prototype applications and webpages with just a prompt? With you, AFFiNE AI can push your creativity to the edge of imagination.

### Local-first, real-time collaboration

- We love the local-first concept, meaning you always own your data on disk, regardless of cloud usage. Additionally, AFFiNE supports real-time synchronization and collaboration on the web and across platform clients.

### Self-host and shape your own AFFiNE

- You're free to manage, self-host, fork, and build your own AFFiNE. Plugin communities and third-party modules are coming soon. Blocksuite has even more traction. Check it out to learn how to self-host AFFiNE.
