# LocalAI
**LocalAI** is a free and open-source alternative to OpenAI. LocalAI serves as a replacement REST API, compatible with OpenAI (Elevenlabs, Anthropic, etc.) API specifications, for local AI inference. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and more) locally or using consumer-grade hardware, supporting various model families. No GPU is required.
