**MkDocs** is a fast, simple, and elegant static site generator suitable for building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

## Features:
- **Great Themes**: MkDocs offers a variety of beautiful themes, including built-in options like `mkdocs` and `readthedocs`, as well as third-party themes or custom-built ones.
- **Customizable**: Customize themes and/or install plugins to make your project documentation look exactly as you want. Extend Markdown behavior with Markdown extensions and configuration options.
- **Live Preview**: The built-in development server allows you to preview your documentation as you write it. It even auto-reloads and refreshes your browser whenever you save changes.
- **Deploy Anywhere**: MkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, or any other hosting platform of your choice.
