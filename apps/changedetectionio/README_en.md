# Changedetection.io
**Changedetection.io** is the best and simplest free open-source website change detection, website monitoring, restock monitoring, and notification service.

- Track changes in PDF files (monitor text changes in PDFs, as well as file size and checksum changes)
- Easily specify how often to check sites
- Execute JS before extracting text (great for login scenarios; see examples in the UI!)
- Override request headers, specify methods like POST or GET, etc.
- Use the "visual selector" to help locate specific elements
- Per-watch configurable proxy
