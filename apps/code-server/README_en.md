- **Multi-Language Support**: Provides broad support for programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, etc. You can handle multiple programming tasks within a unified development environment.
- **Integrated Terminal**: It includes an integrated terminal that lets you run commands, install dependencies, and run applications within the same interface.
- **Version Control**: Integrated version control systems (such as Git) make it easy to manage and track changes to your code.
- **Team Collaboration**: Allows multiple developers to collaborate simultaneously by sharing workspaces and codebases, enhancing team collaboration.
