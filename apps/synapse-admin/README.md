# Synapse admin ui

This project is built using [react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/).

## Usage

### Supported Synapse

It needs at least [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) v1.52.0 for all functions to work as expected!

You get your server version with the request `/_synapse/admin/v1/server_version`.
See also [Synapse version API](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/admin_api/version_api.html).

After entering the URL on the login page of synapse-admin the server version appears below the input field.

### Prerequisites

You need access to the following endpoints:

- `/_matrix`
- `/_synapse/admin`

See also [Synapse administration endpoints](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/reverse_proxy.html#synapse-administration-endpoints)

### Use without install

You can use the current version of Synapse Admin without own installation direct
via [GitHub Pages](https://awesome-technologies.github.io/synapse-admin/).

**Note:**
If you want to use the deployment, you have to make sure that the admin endpoints (`/_synapse/admin`) are accessible for your browser.
**Remember: You have no need to expose these endpoints to the internet but to your network.**
If you want your own deployment, follow the [Step-By-Step Install Guide](#step-by-step-install) below.

### Step-By-Step install

You have three options:

1.  [Download the tarball and serve with any webserver](#steps-for-1)
2.  [Download the source code from github and run using nodejs](#steps-for-2)
3.  [Run the Docker container](#steps-for-3)

#### Steps for 1)

- make sure you have a webserver installed that can serve static files (any webserver like nginx or apache will do)
- configure a vhost for synapse admin on your webserver
- download the .tar.gz from the latest release: https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin/releases/latest
- unpack the .tar.gz
- move or symlink the `synapse-admin-x.x.x` into your vhosts root dir
- open the url of the vhost in your browser

#### Steps for 2)

- make sure you have installed the following: git, yarn, nodejs
- download the source code: `git clone https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin.git`
- change into downloaded directory: `cd synapse-admin`
- download dependencies: `yarn install`
- start web server: `yarn start`

You can fix the homeserver, so that the user can no longer define it himself.
Either you define it at startup (e.g. `REACT_APP_SERVER=https://yourmatrixserver.example.com yarn start`)
or by editing it in the [.env](.env) file. See also the
[documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/).

#### Steps for 3)

- run the Docker container from the public docker registry: `docker run -p 8080:80 awesometechnologies/synapse-admin` or use the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml): `docker-compose up -d`

  > note: if you're building on an architecture other than amd64 (for example a raspberry pi), make sure to define a maximum ram for node. otherwise the build will fail.

  ```yml
  version: "3"

  services:
    synapse-admin:
      container_name: synapse-admin
      hostname: synapse-admin
      build:
        context: https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin.git
        # args:
        #   - NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=1024"
        #   # see #266, PUBLIC_URL must be without surrounding quotation marks
        #   - PUBLIC_URL=/synapse-admin
        #   - REACT_APP_SERVER="https://matrix.example.com"
      ports:
        - "8080:80"
      restart: unless-stopped
  ```

- browse to http://localhost:8080
