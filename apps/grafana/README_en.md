# Grafana
**Grafana** allows you to query, visualize, alert, and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards with your team and foster a data-driven culture.

## Key Features:
- **Visualization**: Fast and flexible client-side graphs with many options. Panel plugins provide many different ways to visualize metrics and logs.
- **Dynamic Dashboards**: Create dynamic and reusable dashboards using template variables displayed as drop-down menus at the top of the dashboard.
- **Explore Metrics**: Explore your data with ad-hoc queries and dynamic drill-down. Split views and compare different time ranges, queries, and data sources side by side.
- **Explore Logs**: Experience the magic of switching from metrics to logs with preserved label filters. Quickly search all your logs or stream them live.
- **Alerting**: Define alert rules for your most important metrics intuitively. Grafana will continuously evaluate them and send notifications to systems like Slack, PagerDuty, VictorOps, OpsGenie, and more.
- **Mixed Data Sources**: Mix different data sources in the same graph! You can specify a data source for each query. This even works for custom data sources.
