## ⚙️ Installation Steps

1. When installing Stalwart, make sure no other application is using the same port. If there’s a conflict (for example, with a web server like OpenResty), you can change Stalwart’s default port to another available one.

2. During the initial setup, scroll down and **enable the following options**:
   - ✅ **Advanced Settings**
   - ✅ **External Access**

3. Once the installation is complete and Stalwart is running, **check the application logs**. If they look similar to the example below, it means the installation was successful and Stalwart is now active.

   > 💡 *Make sure to save the account information shown in the logs. You’ll need it to log in later.*

4. If your system uses a **firewall**, be sure to open the necessary ports for Stalwart using the **TCP protocol**. This allows the email server to work properly.

   > ⚠️ *In this example, port `443` is already being used by OpenResty, so I changed Stalwart’s port to `8443`.*

5. After setup is complete, open your browser and go to the address and port you selected. Use the **username and password from the logs in step 3** to log in.
