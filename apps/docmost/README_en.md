## Configuration and Usage Instructions

After installation, you can configure additional environment variables via the `config.env` file located in the application installation directory. For more information, please refer to the [documentation](https://docmost.com/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables). Environment variables in `config.env` have lower priority than the configuration entered during installation.

If you don’t have multi-user requirements, you can ignore `config.env`. For multi-user collaboration, you must complete the relevant configuration in `config.env` and restart the application.
