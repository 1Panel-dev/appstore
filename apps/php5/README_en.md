PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely used server-side scripting language for developing dynamic web pages and web applications.

## Main Features:

- **Dynamic Web Page Generation**: PHP can be embedded directly into HTML, allowing for the generation of dynamic content. This enables the creation of web pages that respond to user input or other conditions.

- **Error Handling**: PHP provides rich error handling features, allowing developers to capture, log, and handle errors and exceptions effectively.

- **Server-Side Execution**: PHP scripts execute on the server, generating HTML output that the client sees. This keeps the source code secure and hidden from users.

- **Cross-Platform**: PHP runs on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it highly versatile.

- **Open Source and Community Support**: As an open-source project, PHP has a vast developer community offering libraries, extensions, and support.

- **OOP Support**: PHP supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and provides numerous built-in modules and extensions to simplify the development process.
