# NocoBase
**NocoBase** is an extremely extensible open-source no-code development platform. Deploy NocoBase in minutes to have a private, controllable, and highly extensible no-code development platform without years of development or millions in funding.

## Unique Features
### 1. Data Model Driven
Unlike other no-code products that directly create data structures in the user interface, NocoBase separates data structure from the user interface. This allows for the creation of unlimited, flexible data blocks (data views) for each table, with customizable styles, documents, and operations. It combines the simplicity of no-code with the flexibility of native development.

### 2. What You See Is What You Get
NocoBase enables the development of complex and unique business systems without requiring complex operations. With a single click, administrators can configure user interfaces directly in the system, providing a WYSIWYG experience.

### 3. Everything is a Plugin
NocoBase uses a plugin-based architecture. All new features can be implemented through plugin development and installation, making feature expansion as simple as installing an app on a smartphone.
