## Introduction

**NocoBase** is an extremely extensible open-source no-code development platform. Deploy NocoBase in minutes to have a private, controllable, and highly extensible no-code development platform without years of development or millions in funding.

## Features

### 1. Data Model Driven

- Unlike other no-code products that directly create data structures in the user interface, NocoBase separates data structure from the user interface.
- This allows for the creation of unlimited, flexible data blocks (data views) for each table, with customizable styles, documents, and operations. It combines the simplicity of no-code with the flexibility of native development.

### 2. What You See Is What You Get

- NocoBase enables the development of complex and unique business systems without requiring complex operations. With a single click, administrators can configure user interfaces directly in the system, providing a WYSIWYG experience.

### 3. Everything is a Plugin

- NocoBase uses a plugin-based architecture. All new features can be implemented through plugin development and installation, making feature expansion as simple as installing an app on a smartphone.
