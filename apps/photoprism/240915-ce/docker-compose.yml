      # PHOTOPRISM_INIT: "https gpu tensorflow"
      ## Run as a non-root user after initialization (supported: 0, 33, 50-99, 500-600, and 900-1200):
      PHOTOPRISM_UID: ${UID:-1000}
      PHOTOPRISM_GID: ${GID:-1000}
      # PHOTOPRISM_UMASK: 0000
    ## Start as non-root user before initialization (supported: 0, 33, 50-99, 500-600, and 900-1200):
    # user: "1000:1000"
